# Terraform and Provider Version Constraints
# Best Practice: Pin provider versions for consistency across deployments

terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.5.0"

  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~> 3.80"
    }
    azuread = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azuread"
      version = "~> 2.45"
    }
    random = {
      source  = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "~> 3.5"
    }
  }
}

# Provider configuration is handled at root level
# This ensures consistency across all modules
